# GrapheView

This is a little static application using AngularChart to draw fiew mathematical function. It was a little project to get used to with angular's logic. 
You can start using with wamp/mamp or phpstorm as you wish as it requires a local server running. 
Just in case, check of the url in js/services/messages.js is right.
## Requirements

* Angular version 1.4.3
* AngularChart  0.2.7
* AngularBootstrap

The version of angularChart I used doesn't implemented the correction about the loading modal issue(graphs not rendering in hidden divs) but FYI it is resolved.
